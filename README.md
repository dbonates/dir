# dir
> a handy tool for those who are attached to a terminal looking for folders!

I've made this tool to bookmark a directory while I'm on it, so when I want to come back, I just need to remember it's alias, o get it from the list provided by the `-l` argument. ðŸ˜Œ

### How it works

While on a directory, fire the app with parameter `-s` and an alias. Later, you just need to call `dir` with that alias as a parameter and you'll be there!

### Instalation:

Just download the latest binary from releases page and drop it into the `/usr/local/bin/` and you're ready to go.

Of course, feel free to download the source and compile it from your local machine.

TODO:
- integrate with alias on `.bash_profile` so just calling the alias with get you into ðŸ¤˜
